Hello! My name's Patrick Connolly, but the internet lets me go by "patcon".

I'm a **software developer** and **civic hacker**. For me, that means that I'm
interested in the _material_ and the _meta_ of civic life. Which is to say both
the tangible day-to-day, and the more abstract systems which underpin that.

I spend my time trying to help government and civic systems work more like the
open-source communities I know and love.

My primary affiliation (ie. the one I'm most proud of), is being an **animator within the
[Civic Tech Toronto](http://civictech.ca) community**.
