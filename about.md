Hello! My name's Patrick Connolly, but the internet usually lets me go by
"patcon".

I'm a **software developer** and **civic hacker**. For me, that means that I'm
interested in the _material_ and the _meta_ of civic life. Which is to say both
the tangible day-to-day, and the more abstract systems which underpin that.

I spend my time trying to help government and civic systems work more like the
open-source communities I know and love.

My primary affiliation (ie. the one I'm most proud of), is being an **animator**
within the [Civic Tech Toronto](http://civictech.ca) community.

I like to say that I spend time in spaces that capitalism isn't curious
about. It's understandably hard to get paid doing that work, so **please
consider [supporting me on Patreon][patreon]** if you've been positively
affected by things I help maintain!

Not amount is too small -- My gratitude isn't tied to any dollar amounts!
If money isn't the way you move in the world, then no worries :)
