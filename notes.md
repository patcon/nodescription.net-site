Thinking about speculative civic sci-fi related to smart cities.
Wondering if maybe human culture is best thought of as a probability
cloud, not a state machine. Just as the lightbulb was invented in
several different places near the same time, a specific arriving of a
future is not a singular event, but an potentially inevitable field of
moments evoked. And if this consideration of society as a probabibility
space is correct, then it's less of question of _are_ these people doing
this good thing or this bad thing, but _can_ they. If they _can_ do the
bad thing, then that future is more adjacent.

Or considering through a social physics lens. Through that lens, we think about
possibilities through how many hops away an idea is between people.
Maybe we can consider the world we want by how many hops away it might
be -- good or bad -- from a desireable or undesirable possible reality.

Metaphor: We're perhaps moving through the part of the marble tilt maze where
the holes run thick and the steel ball drifts lazily across narrow
surfaces in parabolic arcs.

(Thinking on "Brief History or Everything") Considering emergence and
"holons", that which are both wholes and parts.  Maybe commons-based
peer production is favoured because it involves small pieces that can be
shuffled and _restacked_ in search of emergent properties.

We are matter that encodes descriptions of itself. We rattle the air
between us. We are ball lightning.

How might super-intelligent descendants of cold-blooded lizards think of
or describe _windchill_? Compared to us, it'd be so much more dangerous--a
killer. How would their culture understand it, and talk about it?
